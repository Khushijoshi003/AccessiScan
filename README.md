# **AccessiScan**  
A web-based accessibility analysis tool designed to help developers and website owners ensure their web pages are accessible to users with disabilities. **AccessiScan** scans and evaluates websites for compliance with accessibility standards (like WCAG), focusing on elements such as images, links, buttons, forms, color contrast, ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, heading structure, and focus order.
